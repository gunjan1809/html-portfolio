<h1>The Best Movies According to Gunjan
</h1>
<h2>My top 3 comedy movies of all - time.</h2>
<hr>
<h3>Bhool Bhulaiya </h3>
<p>Bhool Bhulaiya has just the right ingredients of a successful movie â€“ adequate amount of comedy, suspense and thrill to keep you at the edge of your seats throughout. Music is never really great in Priyadarshan movies but Bhool Bhulaiyaa is an exception. </p>
<h3>Dhamaal</h3>
<p>Dhamaal is an amazing and very funny story of four ordinary university dropouts and unemployed men formed their own group of con artists, carrying out theft and other illegal activities to get money. It's truly crazy and a laughing riot. With Director Indra Kumar weaving in new characters, unexpected plots and twists and turns, making it truly come ducal and putting a smile on the faces of the audience although some parts including the plot of the film are based on Rat Race, It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World and Mr. Bean (the British TV Series and it's feature film in 1997).</p>
<h3>Chennai Express</h3>
<p>Say what you want about Rohit Shetty, but the man sure does know to mindlessly entertain you, unlike many of his clones spawned over the past few years, who just numb your senses with their weak endeavors in trying to ape his brand of easygoing, risk-free cinema. "Chennai Express" is actually his best work since "All The Best" (though nothing compared to "All The Best"), and does have a semblance of plot and even some heart, which is usually not the case with most of his projects. The film exceeds expectations for the mere fact that it entertains you for most its duration.</p>
